# python-image-face-finder
This application is a face recognition application developed using the Python programming language. It is created using popular libraries such as OpenCV and Tkinter.This application allows a user to select an image from their computer. It then detects faces on the selected image, draws a rectangle around each detected face, adds the label "human" to each face, and displays this processed image in a window.
